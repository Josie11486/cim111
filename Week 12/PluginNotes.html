<!-- We are discussing jQuery plugins. The first one is about letters. This
plugin splits each letter into its own element so you can really customize
things like fancy titles. I think this is word_split

Line_Split looks at breaks and breaks up each particular string. So if it finds
a break... I really dont get it nvm

We have to choose our own plugins so we can't use the class example ones anyway smh

really look in the notes bc it tells you about all the different plugins and how they work different
