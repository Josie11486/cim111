              <h3>I'm a sophomore at University of Miami</h3>
              <p> I am majoring in communications with a minor in entrepreneurship. I recently joined UM’s student-run communication & marketing consultancy, Orange Umbrella! I am also a member of Alpha Delta Pi, Hurricane Productions Concerts, and the UM Scuba Club. In my free time I like to go to the beach, watch Netflix, and catch up on sleep.

              <h3>Chicago is my favorite city...</h3>
              <p>I grew up in Chicago, Illinois and it is by far my favorite city on earth. There is TONS of great food in addition to deep dish pizza, and there are enough restaurants that you never have to go to the same once twice (but you’ll probably want to). In the summer, whether you’re boating, beaching, or just going for a walk, the lakefront is the place to be. The only downside is that the winters are brutal.</p>

              <h3>... but I love to travel!</h3>
              <p> Despite my love for Chicago, one of my favorite things to do is explore new places. On the left you can see me and my cousin Z sitting on a frozen bench in Iceland. Usually we go somewhere warm over winter break, but for whatever reason, this year we decided to go to the only place colder than home.
