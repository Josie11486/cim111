              <h3>Where's That?</h3>
              <p>Just east of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, there is a maritime paradise
                called the Virgin Islands. Some are British territories and
                others are part of the United States. St. Thomas is the largest USVI
                with a population of about 39,000. It is only 32 square miles in size,
                so small that it is nearly invisible on a full scale map. But all you really
                need to know is that the locals are friendly, the weather is perfect, and the drinks are stong.</p>

              <h3>Vantage Point</h3>
              <p>Our condo is perched in the mountains on the northeast side of the island, marked by the red pin on the map. The island in the distance is called Hans Lollik. It is uninhabited by humans, but it's home to lots of small mountain goats!</p>

              <h3>The Squad</h3>
              <p>Here are the lovely ladies I spent the week with: Bailee, Dimitra, and Joelle.
                Bailee grew up on St. Thomas, where I met her two years ago. She showed us around
                 all week and took us to all the cool local spots! Dimitra is my best friend from
                 high school, known for throwing legendary parties and always having a good time
                 (as you can see, she's always ready to bust a move). Joelle is my BFF and roommate
                 in Miami, but she grew up in Jamaica. A true island girl, she felt right at home. </p>

              <h3>Magen's Bay</h3>
              <p>Here is an overview of the island’s most famous beach, Magen’s Bay! The area was hit pretty badly by Hurricane Irma, but they restored it quickly and it's as beautiful as ever! This is where we spend the majority of the daylight hours, with the exception of one lazy day. </p>

              <p>After 5 days of full sunshine, we had 1 stormy day, but it paid off in the end. It was the perfect finale to our trip!</p>
