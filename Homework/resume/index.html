        <h1>About Me</h1>

        I am originally from Chicago, Illinois but I am currently studying
          communication and media management at University of Miami. In addition to my job experience,
          I am a member of Orange Umbrella, Univeristy of Miami's student
          consultnecy for marketing and public relations. We advise businesses
          on things like design and branding, public relations, and interactive
          media. This summer I would like have a paid internship where I can get project based experience in media and marketing. I am interested in the business and creative side of the industry, so ideally I would like to find a position that includes both. <nav><a href="https://orangeumbrellamiami.com/">Check out the Orange Umbrella website here!</a></nav>
